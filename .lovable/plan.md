# Ecommerce Creative & Launch Services: Complete Design System

## Design Philosophy: "Infrastructure-Grade Brand Execution"

This section operates as a **separate design ecosystem** within your site. While it shares the same technical foundation, it establishes a distinct visual language that signals:

- **Operational precision** over marketing energy
- **Calm confidence** over startup enthusiasm  
- **Execution mastery** over growth promises
- **Infrastructure reliability** over agency flash

## Global Design System for Creative Services

### Color Palette

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `--creative-charcoal` | `hsl(220, 10%, 12%)` | Primary backgrounds, headings |
| `--creative-slate` | `hsl(220, 8%, 25%)` | Secondary text, borders |
| `--creative-stone` | `hsl(30, 5%, 92%)` | Light backgrounds |
| `--creative-warm-white` | `hsl(40, 20%, 98%)` | Card backgrounds |
| `--creative-accent` | `hsl(28, 45%, 55%)` | Restrained accent (terracotta) |
| `--creative-muted` | `hsl(220, 5%, 55%)` | Body text |

No gradients. No glows. Solid, durable colors.

### Typography

| Element | Font | Weight | Size |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| H1 (Hero) | Inter or Space Grotesk | 600 | 56-72px |
| H2 (Section) | Inter | 600 | 36-44px |
| H3 (Card) | Inter | 500 | 20-24px |
| Body | Inter | 400 | 16-18px |
| Caption | Inter | 400 | 14px |

Letter-spacing: Tight on headings (-0.02em), normal on body.

### Spacing Rhythm

- Section padding: 120px vertical (desktop), 80px (mobile)
- Content max-width: 1200px
- Card gaps: 32px
- Large breathing room between elements

### Motion Principles

- Fade-in on scroll: 0.6s ease-out
- No bouncing, no spring animations
- Subtle reveal from bottom (20px translate)
- Stagger delay: 0.1s between elements

## Summary

This plan creates a completely distinctive visual ecosystem that:

1. **Separates creative services** from fulfillment with unique visual language
2. **Signals operational precision** through typography, spacing, and color
3. **Avoids agency cliches** with restrained, infrastructure-grade aesthetics
4. **Uses AI-generated imagery** that feels custom and editorial
5. **Maintains scope clarity** with consistent disclaimers and boundaries
6. **Follows execution-first messaging** without growth promises

The three pages share DNA but have distinct identities:
- Parent: Systems overview, warm neutrals
- Amazon: Technical precision, slightly cooler
- Shopify: Tactile warmth, physical materials
