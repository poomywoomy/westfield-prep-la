## The Prep Center Decision Framework (200 words)

### Step 1: Define Your Needs
Before evaluating prep centers, ask yourself:
- What platforms do I sell on? (Amazon FBA, Shopify, multi-channel)
- What's my monthly order volume? (50, 500, 5,000+ orders)
- What services do I need? (Labeling, branded packaging, kitting)
- What's my budget? (Per-unit costs vs. monthly retainers)
- How important is speed? (Same-day vs. 2-3 day turnaround)

### Step 2: Prioritize Factors
Rank these factors by importance to your business:
1. **Compliance expertise** (critical for Amazon FBA)
2. **Location** (LA port proximity, West Coast shipping)
3. **Turnaround time** (same-day vs. 3-5 days)
4. **Communication** (direct access vs. ticket systems)
5. **Pricing** (transparent, competitive, no hidden fees)
6. **Technology** (inventory tracking, integrations)
7. **Scalability** (can they handle growth?)

### Step 3: Research Options
- Search "Los Angeles prep center" + your platform (e.g., "Shopify")
- Read reviews (Google, Trustpilot, Reddit r/FulfillmentByAmazon)
- Ask for referrals (seller groups, Facebook communities)

### Step 4: Evaluate & Compare
Use the comparison checklist in this guide (below).

**Ideal Location:**

### 3. Turnaround Time & Speed

**Industry Standards:**
- **Fast:** Same-day processing (orders by 2 PM)
